## Play for Keeps

Play for Keeps is Keep Network's ongoing incentivized testnet that rewards community members that run nodes on the Ropsten testnet, and contribute to the ecosystem. This is not limited to development, but can include design and community building. The rewards range from 100-100,000 KEEP, which act as a work token that enable holders to stake and run nodes on Mainnet.
